Image Analyser
Description:
	Write a function that takes an argument of a filename pointing to an image
	Read in an image file and analyse the colours
	Print out a new file with each of the pixels forming a line on a horizontal histogram
	Count increases from left to right
	Do not add spacing or labels.
	The most abundant pixel should be at the top, sorted downwards.
	If 2 colours have same value, sort them by most red, most green then most blue
	Leave empty space white, rgb(0,0,0)
	Don't analyse white in the original image
When is the problem solved?
	When you finish writing to "histogram.png" that contains a histogram of the analysed image
