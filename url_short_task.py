URL Shortener
Description:
	You are asked to develop code for a URL shortening
	service similar to https://goo.gl/. Users of this
	service will provide you URLs such as https://en.
	wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Internet.
	As a result your service should return a shortened
	URL such as http://foo.bar/1xf2. In this task we
	would like you to implement a method shortenURL
	that is called for every input URL. The output of
	this method is a shortened URL for the input URL.
When is the problem solved?
	A shortened URL is returned. Please print the
	output of the method to the console.
